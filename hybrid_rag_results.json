      "\ud83d\udd2c **EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS**:\n\nThe experimental protocol shows consistent patterns across all similar assays (similarity 0.961), all targeting the same TOX21_ERa_LUC_VM7_Agonist endpoint. This is a cell-based luciferase reporter assay using VM7 human breast tissue cells to measure estrogen receptor alpha agonist activity. All similar assays show identical activity values of 59 (Medium category), indicating a consistent baseline response for this specific protocol. The 22-hour exposure time and 1536-well format suggest a standardized high-throughput screening approach optimized for detecting estrogenic activity.\n\n\ud83e\uddec **CHEMICAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**:\n\nThe query molecule (COc1ccc(CCC(C)=O)cc1) shows perfect structural matches (Tanimoto 1.000) with two reference compounds exhibiting Very High (LogAC50: 87) and High (LogAC50: 84) activities. This molecule contains key structural features associated with estrogenic activity: a para-methoxyphenyl group and a propyl ketone chain. The additional similar compounds (Tanimoto 0.788) represent naphthalene analogs with the same functional groups, showing High to Medium activities (LogAC50: 69-80). The molecular weight (178.2) and LogP (2.22) fall within favorable ranges for estrogen receptor binding.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **INTEGRATED PREDICTION LOGIC**:\n\n**Experimental Evidence (Weight 0.50)**: The assay-specific baseline suggests moderate activity (59) for this protocol type.\n\n**Chemical Evidence (Weight 0.50)**: Perfect structural matches demonstrate high estrogenic potential (84-87), while related naphthalene analogs confirm the pharmacophore's activity.\n\n**Conflict Resolution**: The chemical evidence strongly indicates higher activity than the experimental baseline. Given the perfect structural matches with high-activity compounds and the presence of established estrogenic pharmacophores, the chemical evidence provides more specific predictive value than the general assay baseline.\n\n**Weighted Integration**: \n- Experimental contribution: 59 \u00d7 0.50 = 29.5\n- Chemical contribution: 85.5 (average of perfect matches) \u00d7 0.50 = 42.75\n- Combined prediction: 29.5 + 42.75 = 72.25\n\n**FINAL PREDICTION**: 72\n\n**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**: High - Perfect structural matches with known active compounds provide strong chemical evidence, while consistent experimental protocol data supports reliable assay performance. The presence of established estrogenic pharmacophores (para-methoxyphenyl group) further validates the prediction.",
      "\ud83d\udd2c **EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS**:\n\nThe assay TOX21_ERa_LUC_VM7_Agonist_10nM_ICI182780 is an estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) agonist assay using VM7 human breast tissue cells. The protocol includes ICI182780 (fulvestrant), a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), which blocks endogenous estrogen activity to isolate compound-specific agonist effects.\n\nKey experimental insights:\n- All similar assays show identical activity values (64) in the \"Medium\" category\n- The assay design specifically tests for ER\u03b1 agonist activity\n- 22-hour exposure time allows for both direct binding and transcriptional effects\n- High-throughput 1536-well format suggests robust statistical power\n\n**CHEMICAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**:\n\nThe query compound is dibenzyl phosphate, a phosphoric acid diester with two benzyl groups. Structural analysis reveals:\n\nCritical observations from chemical similarity:\n- Three identical compounds (Tanimoto = 1.000) show variable activities: Very High (87), Low (35), and Low (41)\n- This variability suggests assay-dependent or concentration-dependent effects\n- The dibenzyl oxalate analog (Tanimoto = 0.532) shows Low activity (48)\n- Diphenyl phosphate (Tanimoto = 0.511) shows Low activity (38)\n\nStructural features relevant to ER\u03b1 binding:\n- Lacks typical estrogenic pharmacophores (phenolic hydroxyl, steroid backbone)\n- Phosphate group may interact with receptor binding site\n- Benzyl groups provide hydrophobic interactions but lack optimal spacing for ER\u03b1\n\n**INTEGRATED PREDICTION LOGIC**:\n\nCombining experimental (0.50) and chemical (0.50) contexts:\n\nExperimental evidence strongly suggests Medium activity (64) based on consistent assay-specific patterns. The identical assay results provide high confidence in this range.\n\nChemical evidence shows mixed signals - while the exact compound has been tested with variable results (35-87 range), the structural analogs consistently show Low activity (38-48). The lack of classical estrogenic features suggests limited ER\u03b1 agonist potential.\n\nResolution strategy: The experimental context provides more consistent and assay-specific information. The chemical variability likely reflects different assay conditions or concentrations. Given the balanced weighting and the consistency of experimental data, I prioritize the experimental prediction while acknowledging chemical structure limitations.\n\n**FINAL PREDICTION**: 52\n\n**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**: Medium\n\nJustification: While experimental context shows consistent Medium-range activity, the chemical structure analysis reveals significant variability in the same compound's performance and lack of optimal estrogenic features. The balanced weighting (0.50/0.50) requires integration of both contexts. The prediction of 52 represents a compromise between the experimental evidence (suggesting ~64) and chemical evidence (suggesting lower activity based on structural analogs). Medium confidence reflects the tension between consistent experimental data and variable chemical performance.",
      "\ud83d\udd2c **EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS**:\n\nThe TOX21_ERa_BLA_Agonist_ratio assay measures estrogen receptor alpha agonist activity using HEK293T cells over 24 hours. All similar assay entries show consistent activity values of 59 (Medium category), indicating this specific assay configuration tends to produce moderate estrogenic responses. The high similarity scores (0.958) suggest very reliable experimental context data.\n\n\ud83e\uddec **CHEMICAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**:\n\nThe query molecule (C[n+]1ccn(Cc2ccccc2)c1) is a benzyl-substituted imidazolium cation with MW=173.2 and LogP=1.36. \n\n**Perfect Match Evidence**: Most critically, there's an identical molecule (Tanimoto=1.000) with LogAC50=39 (Low activity), providing direct experimental evidence.\n\n**Structural Pattern Analysis**: The related imidazolium derivatives (CCn1cc[n+](C)c1) consistently show much higher activity (LogAC50: 65-87, Medium to Very High). The key difference is the benzyl substitution vs. ethyl substitution, where the bulkier benzyl group appears to significantly reduce estrogenic activity.\n\n**Structure-Activity Relationship**: The benzyl group likely creates steric hindrance that prevents effective binding to the estrogen receptor, explaining the dramatic activity reduction compared to the smaller ethyl analogs.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **INTEGRATED PREDICTION LOGIC**:\n\n**Experimental Context (Weight 0.50)**: Suggests moderate activity (~59) based on assay patterns\n**Chemical Context (Weight 0.50)**: Strongly indicates low activity (~39) based on perfect structural match\n\n**Conflict Resolution**: The perfect chemical match (Tanimoto=1.000) provides definitive evidence that overrides general assay trends. The identical molecule's experimental result of LogAC50=39 is the most reliable predictor.\n\n**Weighted Calculation**: \n- Experimental prediction: 59 \u00d7 0.50 = 29.5\n- Chemical prediction: 39 \u00d7 0.50 = 19.5\n- Combined: 29.5 + 19.5 = 49\n\nHowever, given the perfect structural match, the chemical evidence should be considered more definitive.\n\n**FINAL PREDICTION**: 39\n\n**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**: High - The presence of an identical molecule with experimental data provides the highest possible confidence level. The perfect Tanimoto similarity (1.000) across all fingerprint methods eliminates structural uncertainty, making this prediction highly reliable despite some conflict with general assay patterns.",
      "\ud83d\udd2c **EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS**:\n\nThe experimental protocol data shows consistent patterns across similar assays for TOX21_ERa_LUC_VM7_Antagonist_0.5nM_E2. All three similar assays demonstrate:\n- Identical assay type (estrogen receptor alpha antagonist screening)\n- Consistent activity level of 64 (Medium category)\n- High similarity scores (0.728) indicating reliable protocol matching\n\nThis suggests the assay has moderate sensitivity for detecting ER-alpha antagonistic activity, with a baseline expectation around the medium activity range.\n\n\ud83e\uddec **CHEMICAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**:\n\nThe query molecule (dodecanedioic acid, C12 dicarboxylic acid) shows exceptional structural similarity to known compounds:\n\n**Perfect Matches (Tanimoto 1.000)**:\n- Three identical molecules with varying activities: 88 (Very High), 79 (High), and 30 (Low)\n- This indicates the same compound has been tested multiple times with variable results\n\n**Near-Perfect Matches (Tanimoto 0.984)**:\n- C13 dicarboxylic acid homologs showing High (74) and Very High (87) activities\n- Structural extension by one carbon maintains high activity\n\n**Key Chemical Features**:\n- Linear aliphatic dicarboxylic acid structure\n- MW=230.3, LogP=3.06 (moderate lipophilicity)\n- No obvious ER-antagonist pharmacophores, but chain length may influence membrane interactions\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **INTEGRATED PREDICTION LOGIC**:\n\n**Experimental Weight (0.50)**: Points toward medium activity (~64)\n**Chemical Weight (0.50)**: Shows high variability but trending toward higher activities (average ~72)\n\n**Conflict Resolution**:\nThe chemical context shows the exact same molecule tested multiple times with significant variability (30-88), suggesting experimental variability or concentration-dependent effects. The longer-chain analog consistently shows high activity, supporting a structure-activity relationship.\n\n**Integration Strategy**:\n- Weight the more consistent experimental protocol baseline (64)\n- Adjust upward based on chemical similarity to high-activity compounds\n- Account for experimental variability observed in identical compounds\n\n**Calculation**: (64 \u00d7 0.50) + (72 \u00d7 0.50) = 68\n\n**FINAL PREDICTION**: 68\n\n**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**: Medium\n\n**Justification**: While both contexts provide strong evidence, the significant variability observed in identical chemical structures (30-88 range) introduces uncertainty. The experimental protocol shows consistency, but the chemical evidence reveals inherent variability in this assay for dicarboxylic acids. The prediction represents a balanced estimate accounting for both the experimental baseline and the chemical similarity trends, but confidence is tempered by the observed experimental variability.",

The experimental protocol context shows consistent medium activity (59) across all similar assays, suggesting this specific assay configuration tends to produce moderate responses. However, the experimental context provides limited discriminatory power since all reference assays show identical activity values.\n\n\ud83e\uddec **CHEMICAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**:\n\nThe query molecule is a complex \u03b2-lactam antibiotic derivative (cephalosporin-like structure) with:\n- Core \u03b2-lactam ring fused to a dihydrothiazine ring\n- Methoxyimino group providing stability\n- Aminothiazole side chain\n- Thiadiazole substituent\n\n**Key Chemical Evidence**:\n- **Perfect matches** (Tanimoto 1.000): Show conflicting activities - one very low (28) and one high (84)\n- **Near-identical structures** (Tanimoto 0.837): Consistently show high activity (83-84)\n- The structural differences in high-activity analogs involve tetrazole vs thiadiazole substitution\n- Molecular weight (513.6) and moderate lipophilicity (LogP=0.46) suggest reasonable bioavailability\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **INTEGRATED PREDICTION LOGIC**:\n\n**Conflict Resolution**:\nThe chemical context reveals a critical structure-activity relationship conflict with identical molecules showing vastly different activities (28 vs 84). This suggests:\n1. Potential assay variability or experimental conditions\n2. Possible stereochemical or conformational effects\n3. Concentration-dependent biphasic response\n\n**Weight-Balanced Analysis** (50:50):\n- Experimental context: Points toward medium activity (~59)\n- Chemical context: Shows bimodal distribution but leans toward higher activity (4/5 analogs show high activity 83-84)\n\n**Resolution Strategy**:\nGiven the structural complexity and the predominance of high-activity analogs in the chemical dataset, combined with the moderate experimental baseline, I predict activity in the medium-high range.\n\n**FINAL PREDICTION**: 72\n\n**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**: Medium\n\n**Justification**: While we have perfect structural matches, the conflicting activity data (28 vs 84 for identical structures) introduces significant uncertainty. The experimental context provides a stable baseline but limited discrimination. The predominance of high-activity similar structures (4/5 showing 83-84) supports a higher prediction than the experimental baseline, leading to a medium-high prediction with moderate confidence due to the inherent data conflicts.",

This is a luciferase reporter assay conducted in the presence of ICI182780 (fulvestrant), a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). The consistent activity score of 64 (Medium category) across all similar assays suggests this represents a baseline or reference measurement for this specific protocol.\n\nKey experimental factors:\n- 22-hour exposure time allows for transcriptional responses\n- 1536-well format indicates high-throughput screening\n- ICI182780 presence suggests measurement of competitive agonism\n- VM7 breast tissue cells are relevant for estrogenic activity assessment\n\n\ud83e\uddec **CHEMICAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**:\n\nThe query molecule shows remarkable structural consistency with training data:\n- **Perfect matches** (Tanimoto 1.000): Two identical molecules with LogAC50 values of 83-84 (High activity)\n- **Near-identical variants** (Tanimoto 0.856): Molecules differing only by a carboxylic acid group, showing mixed activity (43-83 LogAC50)\n\nStructural features relevant to ER\u03b1 activity:\n- **Diphenylmethanol core**: Classic pharmacophore for estrogen receptor binding\n- **Piperidine linker**: Provides appropriate spacing and flexibility\n- **tert-Butylphenol group**: Bulky aromatic substituent that may influence receptor selectivity\n- **High lipophilicity** (LogP=6.45): Favorable for membrane permeation but may affect solubility\n\nThe molecule's architecture resembles selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) with the diphenyl tertiary alcohol being a key binding motif.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **INTEGRATED PREDICTION LOGIC**:\n\n**Chemical Evidence (Weight 0.50)**:\n- Perfect structural matches show consistently high activity (83-84)\n- Minor structural variants show variable activity (43-83)\n- Core pharmacophore strongly suggests ER\u03b1 interaction capability\n\n**Experimental Evidence (Weight 0.50)**:\n- Assay baseline of 64 provides reference point\n- Protocol designed to detect competitive ER\u03b1 agonism\n- 22-hour timeframe captures transcriptional responses\n\n**Integration Strategy**:\nThe chemical evidence strongly favors high activity based on perfect structural matches, while the experimental context suggests moderate baseline activity. Given equal weighting and the strength of the chemical similarity data (perfect matches with high activity), the prediction should lean toward the higher end while acknowledging the experimental baseline.\n\n**Conflict Resolution**:\nThe chemical evidence (83-84 activity) is more specific and directly relevant than the general experimental baseline (64). The perfect structural matches provide compelling evidence for high activity.\n\n**FINAL PREDICTION**: 82\n\n**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**: High\n\n**Justification**: \n- **Chemical confidence**: Very high due to perfect structural matches (Tanimoto 1.000) with consistent high activity\n- **Experimental confidence**: Medium due to relevant assay design but limited specificity to the query molecule\n- **Overall confidence**: High because the chemical evidence is exceptionally strong (identical molecules) and the experimental context is appropriate for the predicted activity range\n- The prediction of 82 aligns closely with the 83-84 values from identical structures while acknowledging potential experimental variability",
